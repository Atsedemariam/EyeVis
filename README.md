# EyeVis
A Python Project based on Object detection using Google's Tensorflow to provide vision to the blind and provide some basic translations to common man

#### EyeVis or we should say I Wish is a unique concept implemented using the Google's Tensorflow API and some of the recognized algorithms in the field of image processing and deep learning.

#### Imagine what would a blind ,elderly or an illiterate person may wish. He/She would say "I Wish I Could See,I Wish I could interpret,I Wish I could understand

#### EyeVis will provide the exact platform for and services to these people and will try to some basic common day-to-day problems of a common man such as reading a Bar Code, Language Translation ,danger detection while driving which may be further upgraded  by using Self-learning techniques available in the market.

#### As far as the Blind are concerned ,for them tools have been developed which would help them by detecting some objects' distance using some electromagnetic waves.But no one has ever tried to actually make them see the real world

## Features
- Object Detection of upto 256 categories(could be further increased)
- Warning Messages if some vehicle is approaching too close
- Text to Speech for all the messages generated
- Implement scene detection using MIT's available API
- Optical Character Recognition(on button press) 
- Read Aloud Text from OCR in different languages.
- Will try to implement all the features in android as well
